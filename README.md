# FORKBOMB
### `init.sh` Explanation

This script contains a piece of code known as a "fork bomb" within the Bash scripting language.<br>
The script defines a function named `:` (colon), which recursively calls itself twice: `:|:&`. LOL :rofl:

- `:` is the function name, followed by `()`, defining an anonymous function in Bash.
- `:|:` is a shorthand for the function calling itself and sending the output to another instance of the function.
- `&` puts each function call in the background, allowing multiple instances to be created.

**Caution: <br>Based on reported incidents from other users, executing this script has led to severe problems with their systems, causing instability and unresponsiveness.**

**Advice: This script should only be executed on a sandboxed system or a test environment within a hypervisor.** 

This piece of code is commonly used as an educational example in IT security training to illustrate the concept of a fork bomb and the importance of understanding potentially harmful code. 

Running this script in a live environment or on a shared system is highly discouraged.<br>
When executed, it rapidly spawns numerous processes until system resources are exhausted, potentially leading to a system freeze.

Please use extreme caution and ensure you are in a controlled environment before executing this script for educational or experimental purposes. Its execution in any other context can cause significant disruption.
